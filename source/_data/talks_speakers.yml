  speaker_bio: "Hi! I am Gosia, but some people know me as a mom, a daughter, some as friend, others coworker, but for some, I am just “ey, you!”. A few years back I graduated from Automatic Control and Robotics, and soon after starting my job in that field, I knew... it's not for me. So I started looking for something new. Then.. it hit me how cool was programming during my studies, so HERE I AM!<br /><br />For quite a few years now I have been working as a full-stack developer with .NET and React (and knockout, Angular JavaScript..). However, recently I have been feeling a growing passion and interest in DevOps too. I am only beginning my DevOps journey, but I am facing some exciting challenges. <br /><br />At the times when I am not coding, you will probably find me either playing with our little one, in my cave painting or trying to play piano."

This approach works well for Preply (a B2C language learning portal) and WorkWave (B2B field service software), and other companies are approaching the topic the same way."

        talk_description: >-
          Powerful generative AI features are quickly becoming a baseline in modern development.<br /> 
          Potential blockers include privacy concerns, the need for a stable connection, and the costs 
          associated with using or hosting models. However, we can now leverage generative AI directly 
          in the browser on the user's device using emerging Web APIs like WebNN, combined with 
          higher-level frameworks, for a better developer experience.<br /><br />In my session, I'll 
          discuss the current state of in-browser ML and AI features, compare the main players, and 
          show you how to start building an offline-ready, future-proof, standards-based web application.

Next, we'll break down the latest changes in regulations, and discuss ways to quickly assess whether your current website meets these new standards.<br />We'll talk about how you can identify and tackle critical issues right away, and we'll explore strategies for embedding accessibility into every stage of development.<br /><br />Ultimately, this talk is about taking what feels like a daunting challenge and making it manageable.

          As programmers we use abstractions all the time, but do we ever care about their costs? <br />
          And what does it even mean for an abstraction to have a *cost*? <br />
          In this talk, we'll explore different abstractions available to Javascript developers and their impact on developer productivity, team health, and application runtime behavior. <br /> 
          While we're at it, we'll also see how different languages available to frontend developers (hint: Rust and WASM-targeting languages) have radically different abstraction costs.

These hurdles included managing TypeScript''s lack of strict semantic versioning guarantees and accommodating various TS flavors.<br /><br />Today, the experimental native TypeScript support in Node.js marks a transformative milestone.

          If you're a web developer, JavaScript is probably the language you're using the most. But it's also a language that never ceases to gives us surprises. How many times did we say "Huh, so it behaves like that!", or "I didn't know that API existed!", or just "This is so weird..."
          <br /><br />And it's just that: JavaScript is weird. Being the language itself, with its quirkiness thoroughly examined in many occasions; or in the case of weird, less-known, or just DOM APIs with unusual signatures and implementations. But maybe some of these techniques, which could have been common knowledge, are still useful today and could solve our day-to-day problems.
