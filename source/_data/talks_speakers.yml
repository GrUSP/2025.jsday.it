I am Gosia, but some people know me as a mom, a daughter, some as friend, others coworker, but for some, I am just `Hey, you!` A few years back I graduated from Automatic Control and Robotics, and soon after starting my job in that field, I knew... it's not for me. So I started looking for something new. Then.. it hit me how cool was programming during my studies, so HERE I AM!<br /><br />For quite a few years now I have been working as a full-stack developer with .NET and React (and knockout, Angular JavaScript..). However, recently I have been feeling a growing passion and interest in DevOps too. I am only beginning my DevOps journey, but I am facing some exciting challenges. <br /><br />At the times when I am not coding, you will probably find me either playing with our little one, in my cave painting or trying to play piano."

        talk_description: >
          When building interactive features on a webpage, JavaScript is usually the way to go. However, with great JavaScript dependencies comes great website instability. Even a minor undefined element can cause your entire webpage to crash.<br /><br />
          That's where going back to the basics comes in. Thanks to modern Web APIs, it's now possible to reduce JavaScript dependency on a website by swapping out JS components for their native HTML element or CSS feature counterparts.<br /><br />
          In this talk, we'll take a look at how to use HTML and CSS to build simpler alternatives to popular JavaScript components such as accordions, modals, scroll transitions, carousels etc We'll also take a look at the performance and accessibility benefits and real-life applications and use-cases of these components.

        talk_description: >
          Traditionally JavaScript has always been interpreted or just-in-time compiled, while this works great for web browsers, outside of them they can be non-ideal due to resource restrictions, security concerns, and more.<br /><br />
          Compiling JS ahead-of-time is a new option offering exciting new ways to use JS efficiently: instead of shipping an entire runtime to the end user, why not compile it like C++ or Rust?<br /><br />
          While ahead-of-time has it's own challenges, for some uses it makes much more sense than previous existing solutions thanks to its characteristics like tiny binary sizes and efficient resource usage.<br /><br />
          Porffor is a new open-source project which does exactly this! With already promising results, it makes ahead-of-time increasingly considered as one of JS's future paths forward."

        talk_description: >
          Building seamless user experiences can be challenging when APIs aren't designed with frontend needs in mind. This talk tackles common issues like excessive network requests, inefficient caching, resilience gaps, and bloated API payloads. Through a real-world fintech case study, we'll explore how to address these obstacles using tools like Next.js, TanStack Query, and the Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) design pattern. You'll learn how to evolve data-fetching strategies from basic implementations to robust solutions that balance performance and resilience, even under the constraints of APIs serving multiple third-party clients. The session highlights practical strategies for overcoming limitations and empowering frontend teams to work effectively, despite backend constraints.<br /><br />
          We'll dive into a case where a fintech team I lead faced massive API payloads filled with unnecessary data, creating performance bottlenecks and resilience challenges. By adopting the BFF pattern and leveraging Next.js for server-side rendering and API routing, they reduced payload sizes and streamlined caching strategies. TanStack Query optimized server to client state management and minimized re-renders, ensuring scalability and better user experiences. With demos, this talk equips developers with actionable techniques to build resilient and scalable frontend solutions in real-world conditions.

          In this talk, we'll explore different abstractions available to JavaScript developers and their impact on developer productivity, team health, and application runtime behavior. <br /> 
          While we're at it, we'll also see how different languages available to frontend developers (hint: Rust and WASM-targeting languages) have radically different abstraction costs.

        talk_title: "Developing Resilience"
        talk_description:
          "Within tech, things change constantly. Technologies change, companies change, priorities change - in most roles you need to learn how to adapt and roll with whatever comes your way. Things will always be in flux and a key skill is learning how to deal with change and become more resilient to it.<br /><br />
          Especially with the current state of the industry, it's become even more important to build your own resilience and learn to become more adaptable. As managers, we need to be aware of our own emotions, reactions and behaviours, understand how we can be more resilient to change and how to help build that resilience in the people we manage.<br /><br />
          This talk will examine the psychology behind emotions and resilience, how to recognise and evaluate your own state, and how to come up with techniques to help deal with the hardest stuff."

        talk_description: "The need to show how much the Design System empowers our customers' interactions makes us color and count pixels straight in the browser instead of following a more typical static analysis approach.<br /><br />The desire to be independent of product teams and their always-packed OKRs leads us to count pixels in production when customers interact with the product.<br /><br />The requirement to not impact our customers' UX even if they use feature phones drives us to idle callbacks and web workers and consult a former Google Chrome engineer to lower the memory footprint as much as possible.<br /><br />Doing the same for React Native required more shenanigans (it's harder to inspect the rendered tree in a Mobile environment), and a safer approach, but it's also working!<br /><br />We will present our experience to show engineers and company leaders the measurable value of the Design System in our products. This approach works well for Preply (a B2C language learning portal) and WorkWave (B2B field service software), and other companies are approaching the topic the same way."

These hurdles included managing TypeScript''s lack of strict semantic versioning guarantees and accommodating various TS flavors.<br /><br />Today, the experimental native TypeScript support in Node.js marks a transformative milestone. Beyond merely executing .ts files, it signifies a leap forward in JavaScript development.'

        talk_description: >
          Micro Frontends may have a relatively new name, but the concepts behind them have been around for much longer. Some call them the future of Frontend Development, and many recognize their potential to address one of today's biggest web development challenges: scaling the frontend of large applications.<br /><br />
          At DAZN, a global live sports streaming platform serving millions of users, our Micro Frontend journey began five years ago. Back then, it was just a single team venturing into this new territory. Since then, we've grown exponentially, experiencing failures, breakthroughs, and plenty of experimentation with different solutions, tools, and approaches. I'd love to share our story and what we've learned along the way.<br /><br />
          This talk is dedicated to Mary, who's tired of waiting for other teams to align their releases. It's for Brent, who abandoned a migration from React to Svelte because convincing multiple teams felt impossible. And it's for Julie, who found herself on call during a live incident, scrambling to understand 17 code changes deployed just hours earlier. Sound familiar?

          If you're a web developer, JavaScript is probably the language you're using the most. But it's also a language that never ceases to gives us surprises. How many times did we say "Huh, so it behaves like that!", or "I didn't know that API existed!", or just "This is so weird..."
          <br /><br />And it's just that: JavaScript is weird. Being the language itself, with its quirkiness thoroughly examined in many occasions; or in the case of weird, less-known, or just DOM APIs with unusual signatures and implementations. But maybe some of these techniques, which could have been common knowledge, are still useful today and could solve our day-to-day problems.
          <br /><br />Just don't use them in production! Not for now, at least..."

          Powerful generative AI features are quickly becoming a baseline in modern development.<br /> 
          Potential blockers include privacy concerns, the need for a stable connection, and the costs 
          associated with using or hosting models. However, we can now leverage generative AI directly 
          in the browser on the user's device using emerging Web APIs like WebNN, combined with 
          higher-level frameworks, for a better developer experience.<br /><br />In my session, I'll 
          discuss the current state of in-browser ML and AI features, compare the main players, and 
          show you how to start building an offline-ready, future-proof, standards-based web application.
