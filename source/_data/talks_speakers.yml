  speaker_role: "Senior Full-Stack Developer @ Sector Alarm IT"
  speaker_bio: "Hi! I am Gosia, but some people know me as a mom, a daughter, some as friend, others coworker, but for some, I am just “ey, you!”. A few years back I graduated from Automatic Control and Robotics, and soon after starting my job in that field, I knew... it's not for me. So I started looking for something new. Then.. it hit me how cool was programming during my studies, so HERE I AM!<br /><br />For quite a few years now I have been working as a full-stack developer with .NET and React (and knockout, Angular JavaScript..). However, recently I have been feeling a growing passion and interest in DevOps too. I am only beginning my DevOps journey, but I am facing some exciting challenges. <br /><br />At the times when I am not coding, you will probably find me either playing with our little one, in my cave painting or trying to play piano."

        talk_description: "The need to show how much the Design System empowers our customers' interactions makes us color and count pixels straight in the browser instead of following a more typical static analysis approach.<br /><br />The desire to be independent of product teams and their always-packed OKRs leads us to count pixels in production when customers interact with the product.<br /><br />The requirement to not impact our customers' UX even if they use feature phones drives us to idle callbacks and web workers and consult a former Google Chrome engineer to lower the memory footprint as much as possible.<br /><br />Doing the same for React Native required more shenanigans (it's harder to inspect the rendered tree in a Mobile environment), and a safer approach, but it's also working!<br /><br />We will present our experience to show engineers and company leaders the measurable value of the Design System in our products. This approach works well for Preply (a B2C language learning portal) and WorkWave (B2B field service software), and other companies are approaching the topic the same way."

        talk_description: >-
          Powerful generative AI features are quickly becoming a baseline in modern development.<br /> 
          Potential blockers include privacy concerns, the need for a stable connection, and the costs 
          associated with using or hosting models. However, we can now leverage generative AI directly 
          in the browser on the user's device using emerging Web APIs like WebNN, combined with 
          higher-level frameworks, for a better developer experience.<br /><br />In my session, I'll 
          discuss the current state of in-browser ML and AI features, compare the main players, and 
          show you how to start building an offline-ready, future-proof, standards-based web application.

But is this really so? <br /><br />Let’s break some popular cases down together and see if JavaScript really is weird or maybe it’s just a myth getting more and more popular?"
